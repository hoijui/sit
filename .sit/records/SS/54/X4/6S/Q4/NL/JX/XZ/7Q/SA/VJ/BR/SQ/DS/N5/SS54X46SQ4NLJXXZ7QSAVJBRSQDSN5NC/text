Currently, `sit web` is distributed as a separate program. It has a few
downsides:

1. It is confusing in terms of distribution. Which tool does the user
need?
2. It has a bunch of business logic copied nearly verbatim from `sit`
(figuring out where a repository should be, etc.)

Solution: integrate it into the main program
