Solution: fail to start sit-web if authorship is not configured

The above failure happens when a user is starting sit web without
pre-configured authorship (and one can't be derived from elsewhere, like
git) and is trying to create a record.

`sit record` doesn't have this problem because it checks whether there's
any authorship to derive and fails if there's none. However, `sit web`
didn't do this. This patch makes sit-web unable to start until such
authorship can be derived.

I want to note that (soon-ish) this functionality will be on its way out
as I have a plan to extract it out of sit as it doesn't really belong
there (along with timestamps, PGP, etc.). Until this is done, however,
the tool should be usable and produce no confusing crashes.
