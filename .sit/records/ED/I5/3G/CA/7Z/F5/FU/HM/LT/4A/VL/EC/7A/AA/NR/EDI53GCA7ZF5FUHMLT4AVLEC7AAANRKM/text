Currently, directory resolution (`resolve_dir`) will happily resolve to
any location. However, this might be a privacy/security risk if
arbitrary files are referred to from within records as their content can
be read.

Solution: introduce mandatory `root` argument

This argument restricts the prefix allowed for the resolution. So, for
example, if the root is set to "/path/to/repo" and the link resolves to
"/another/path", then it'll return a `NotFound` error instead. However,
if, for example, "/" is passed, then it'll resolve just fine.

Record iteration (and some deprecated items functionality) restricts its
scope to the repository.

Important note:

I've attempted doing the same for modules, however, after I implemented
it I realized that there are cases when modules are actually referenced
outside of the repository (issue-tracking module is a good example of
it). It's STILL a privacy/security risk but (hopefully) a slightly more
apparent one (easier to detect... perhaps). In the future, we might
consider tightening this one up as well if we can eliminate the need to
refer to modules outside of the scope. This concern is recorded in issue
